2.1 Mongo DB

Here, we've built a collection in MongoDB called "football_team_players" and populated it with dummy player information.
Then, using five representative requests, 
we showed how a RESTful API for a football team may be used. This outline and these questions are flexible enough to meet your requirements, 
no matter what sport you're into.
